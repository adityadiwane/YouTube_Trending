His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial► Edited ByBecky Johnson"

That action, mainly produced at the hands of Masvidal, would end up being the catalyst to the tune inside the world's most famous arena very quickly as the brutal damage he inflicted to the right eye of Diaz brought a stop to the historic matchup early. Heading into Round 4, the cage side doctor reentered the cage to give a second look to the battered eye of Diaz and shortly thereafter called a stop to the bout, giving Masvidal the TKO victory and the BMF championship.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time."

Stand up against people who judge others and use your voice - WEAR IT OUT LOUD! merch back in stock! SHOP http://storybooth.com/store  LIMITED QUANTITIES! This story took place when Emma was younger - around five or six years old. One night, a group of teenagers were bored and decided to steal their grandpa's gun. They took the weapon, headed to their car and drove around town. Emma does not believe that the teenagers had any truly bad intentions, and she doesn't think they wanted to hurt anyone, but the group started shooting around. They shot at an abandoned house on her street, and they destroyed a truck that was parked nearby. The group of teenagers assumed Emma's house was abandoned, too, so they started to shoot at her window. Emma was home and asleep at the time. The bullet traveled through her bedroom window and went right through her arm. Emma woke up - not understanding what had just happened - and felt a pain in her arm. She felt scared and confused. She tried to go back to sleep, but the pain wouldn't go away, so she decided to head to her dad's room. Her dad asked her what was wrong, and she told him that her arm was hurting her. Because it was so dark, Emma's dad didn't immediately see anything wrong with her. But when he turned on the TV to help her fall asleep, he was shocked by what he saw in the light - Emma was covered in blood. Emma's dad started to freak out, and he looked at her arm and noticed a huge wound. But because no one in their house had her a gun shot, they didn't think it was a bullet wound - they had no idea what it could have been. Emma's dad immediately picked her up and headed to their car. But before they could leave to go get help, they were stopped by police officers in their neighborhood - that's when they learned that she had been shot. Emma and her family were shocked, and they waited for an ambulance to arrive. Emma was in the hospital for three days and, luckily, her arm healed. Her class made her really sweet cards while she was in the hospital, and she really appreciated their support. The three teenagers were caught by the police, and they ended up going to jail for what they did. Emma can hardly believe it when she looks back at the experience and says to herself, They went to jail for what they did to me.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

The answer might be that  planet Earth is more unique than we've previously assumed. The rare earth hypothesis posits exactly this - that a range of factors made Earth exceptionally unusual and uniquely able to produce intelligent life. In upcoming episodes we’ll be exploring the anthropic principle and its two main versions - the strong and the weak anthropic principles. The strong anthropic principle tells us that the observed universe must be able to produce observers - including the contentious idea that this predicts the existence of universes beyond our own. But in today's episode we’re going to focus on the weak anthropic principle. It says that we must find ourselves in a part of the universe capable of supporting us. For example, in a planetary biosphere rather than floating in the void between the galaxies. This may seems tautological, but accounting for this observer selection bias is important to understanding why the universe looks the way it does from our perspective. And the weak anthropic principle is much more useful than that. When combined with the apparent absence of alien civilizations, it may tell us why intelligent life is incredibly rare in our universe.Hosted by Matt O'DowdWritten by Matt O'DowdGraphics by Leonardo Scholzer & Adriano LealDirected by: Andrew KornhaberExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew KornhaberSpecial Thanks to Our Patreon SupportersBIg Bang Supporters: Alexander TamasDavid BarnholdtDavid NicklasFabrice EapJohn SJuan Benetmatt millerMorgan HoughQuasar SupportersMark HeisingMark RosenthalVinnie FalcoHypernovachuck zegarDanton SpiveyDonal BotkinEdmund FokschanerHank Sjoe pearceJohn HofmannJohn R.

Watch the new trailer for Disney & Pixar’s Soul now. About Soul: Directed by two-time Academy Award®-winner Pete Docter, co-directed by Kemp Powers and produced by Academy Award®-nominee Dana Murray, Disney and Pixar’s “Soul” opens in theaters on June 19, 2020. According to Docter, the idea for the story is 23 years in the making. “It started with my son—he’s 23 now—but the instant he was born, he already had a personality,” says Docter. “Where did that come from? I thought your personality developed through your interaction with the world. And yet, it was pretty clear that we’re all born with a very unique, specific sense of who we are.” “Soul” introduces Joe Gardner, a middle-school band teacher whose true passion is playing jazz. “I think Joe is having that crisis that all artists have,” says Powers. “He’s increasingly feeling like his lifelong dream of being a jazz musician is not going to pan out and he’s asking himself ‘Why am I here? What am I meant to be doing?’ Joe personifies those questions.”In the film, just when Joe thinks his dream might be in reach, a single unexpected step sends him to a fantastical place where he’s is forced to think again about what it truly means to have soul. That’s where he meets and ultimately teams up with 22, a soul who doesn’t think life on Earth is all it’s cracked up to be. Jamie Foxx lends his voice to Joe, while Tina Fey voices 22. “The comedy comes naturally,” says Murray. “But the subtle emotion that reveals the truth to the characters is really something special.” Facebook: http://facebook.com/pixarsoul/Twitter: http://twitter.com/pixarsoulInstagram: http://instagram.com/pixarsoul/YouTube: http://youtube.com/pixarHashtag: #PixarSoul"

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial► Edited ByBecky Johnson"

RM9auBS2u7Y,Squishy Makeovers: Fixing Your Squishies #18,08-11-2019 21:00,UCYAB7hh1ohA8-iX54EpMdeA,Moriah Elizabeth,24,10-11-2019 03:03,squishy makeover|crafting for adults|fun painting projects for teens|how to fix squishies,2721111,97469,1527,18509,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RM9auBS2u7Y/default.jpg,FALSE,FALSE,"AD | Take 20% off when you shop at Arteza for the next 7 days using MORIAH20 at checkout https://arteza.com/moriahWelcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. 8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit. I spend multiple weeks working on them (in combination with my other videos) so it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my art and craft videos as well!___WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh "

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time."

Stand up against people who judge others and use your voice - WEAR IT OUT LOUD! merch back in stock! SHOP http://storybooth.com/store  LIMITED QUANTITIES! Jennie wants to share her experience and struggles with OCD - Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Although people might assume that OCD is all about keeping things neat and tidy, OCD can affect people in different ways. For Jennie, her OCD made her feel like she always had to keep things even. For example, if Jennie saw two books on a table that weren't perfectly lined up and even, Jennie would feel the need to rearrange the books and fix their position. However, it wasn't as simple as just moving the books around - Jennie had a whole system for fixing things that wasn't always easy to explain to other people.Because of her OCD, Jennie felt like she had to do certain things and complete specific tasks to feel at peace. Although she was right-handed, she decided to go an entire year using her left hand to do things so that her left side was even with her right side. Then, once the year had passed, she felt like she had to use both her right and left hands equally to keep things balanced and fair. It was extremely difficult for her, and it started to really impact her days at school, time with friends and overall daily life.Her OCD felt like it was only getting more difficult to handle. She started to count all of her body movements, and she felt like she had to keep track every time she would breathe or blink. She began to feel like someone was listening to her thoughts, and if she didn't think or feel the right thing, she may be punished. Finally, Jennie decided to talk to her parents and explain how she was feeling. They brought her to a counselling, and a counselor was really able to help her. Now, Jennie doesn't feel so overwhelmed by her disorder. Jennie wants other people to know how important it is to NOT suffer in silence, and she hopes her story can help someone who may also be struggling with OCD.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

HE CAME UP TO US WITH THAT HUGE SMILE YOU SEE IN THE NEXT SLIDE. HE IMMEDIATELY SAID TO ME, “THE DUCKS DON'T MIND” AND LAUGHED. I INTRODUCED HIM TO SYD, HE SAID “I KNOW YOU, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOREVER, 10 YEARS RIGHT?” AND SHE LAUGHED.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial► Edited ByBecky Johnson"

Those equations always include one or more fundamental constants - simple numbers that set the scale for the equation. We can’t determine the values of these constants from pure theory - we have to measure them in the real universe. These are things like the speed of light, the Planck constant, the masses of the elementary particles, and the constants defining the relative strengths of the fundamental forces - the so-called coupling constants.Special Thanks to Our Patreon SupportersBig BangAlexander TamasCraig StonahaDavid BarnholdtDavid NicklasFabrice EapJohn SJuan Benetmatt millerMorgan Hough QuasarMark HeisingMark RosenthalVinnie Falco HypernovaChuck ZegarDanton SpiveyDonal BotkinEdmund FokschanerHank SJohn HofmannJohn R.

Forever and everTake me outAnd take me homeYou’re my, my, my, my... LoverWe could light a bunch of candles and dance around the kitchen, babyPictures of when we were young Would hang on the wallWe would sit on the stoop I’ll sing love songs to you when we’re eightySee I finally got you now, honeyI won’t let you fallCan I go where you go?Can we always be this close? Forever and everTake me outAnd take me homeYou’re my, my, my, my... LoverLadies and gentlemenWill you please standWith every guitar string scar on my hand I take this magnetic force of a manTo be my loverLook in my eyes, they will tell you the truth The girl in my story, has always been youI’d go down with the Titanic, it’s true For you… LoverAnd you’ll save all your dirtiest jokes For meAnd at every table, I’ll save you a seat Lover…Can I go where you go?Can we always be this close?Forever and everTake me outAnd take me homeYou’re my, my, my, my... Oh you’re my, my, my, my... Darling you’re my, my, my, my...Lover#TaylorSwift #ShawnMendes #LoverRemix© 2019 Taylor Swift"

Guests, all of whom have saved room in their stomachs for dessert, will ask: 'What type of pies did the hosts provide? What was the quality of the crust? Was this pumpkin pie pumpkin-y enough?' Claire and Brad want you to pass your guests' pie grading, so they've endeavored to make the perfect Thanksgiving pie. Check out the final recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pecan-rye-pumpkin-pieAnd find all of the Making Perfect recipes here: https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/absolutely-perfect-thanksgiving-menuImagine a pumpkin pie with pecan pie’s best feature—obviously, the candied nut topping. Now spike the custard with rye whiskey, up the flavor of the crust with rye flour, and voilà: pecan-rye pumpkin pie. We use Libby’s canned pumpkin because it’s reliably consistent, with an ideal water content, and few variations in flavor (and no, we’re not paid to say that). The egg wash added during the blind bake serves as a moisture-fighting barrier—a seal-tight guarantee that the bottom crust won’t get soggy. The rye flour will make the crust look darker than your standard pie dough. If it starts getting too dark while baking with the custard filling, tent it with a ring of foil.Want Bon Appétit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promoStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appétit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPnWant more Bon Appétit in your life?

If you’re thinking that sounds familiar, then you much have been around for the first Motorola RAZR launch back in 2004! Despite its high price, that RAZR product family would go on to sell 130 million units over the next four years, going down in the history books as the most successful flip phone of all time.

General Motors' Hummer was a coveted status symbol sought by celebrities and a sometimes mocked and vilified example of how far of America's newfound love for SUVs had gone. But in 2009, GM put several of its brands to the ax, including Pontiac, Saab, and Hummer. While the Hummer had a brief lifespan of just under two decades, it made a lasting impression on the auto industry.Clarification: General Motors ended Oldsmobile production in 2004, a few years before GM stopped producing the other brands mentioned at 8:05.» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

While on a forgettable first date together in Ohio, a black man (Get Out’s Daniel Kaluuya) and a black woman (Jodie Turner-Smith, in her first starring feature-film role), are pulled over for a minor traffic infraction. The situation escalates, with sudden and tragic results, when the man kills the police officer in self-defense. Terrified and in fear for their lives, the man, a retail employee, and the woman, a criminal defense lawyer, are forced to go on the run. But the incident is captured on video and goes viral, and the couple unwittingly become a symbol of trauma, terror, grief and pain for people across the country. As they drive, these two unlikely fugitives will discover themselves and each other in the most dire and desperate of circumstances, and will forge a deep and powerful love that will reveal their shared humanity and shape the rest of their lives. Joining a legacy of films such as Bonnie and Clyde and Thelma & Louise, Queen & Slim is a powerful, consciousness-raising love story that confronts the staggering human toll of racism and the life-shattering price of violence. Waithe wrote the script based on an original idea by bestselling author James Frey (A Million Little Pieces, Katerina). The feature-film directorial debut from Melina Matsoukas (executive producer of HBO’s Insecure) stars Academy Award® nominee Daniel Kaluuya as “Slim” and rising star Jodie Turner-Smith (Syfy’s Nightflyers), as “Queen.” Waithe produces the film via her company, Hillman Grad Productions, along with Matsoukas via her production company, De La Revolución Films. Frey produces via his production company, 3BlackDot, alongside Andrew Coles and Michelle Knudsen.

It’s the rarest, most expensive, and potentially the most dangerous material on earth. Scientists don’t know why this material is so rare. Anti-atoms took 72 years after we discovered antimatter to make. Why?Thanks to CERN, Elise Wursten, Loïc Bommersbach and Sarah Charleyhttp://physicsgirl.org/ http://twitter.com/thephysicsgirlhttp://facebook.com/thephysicsgirlhttp://instagram.com/thephysicsgirlCreator/Host: Dianna Cowern Editor: Levi Butner Research & Writing: Dianna & Imogen AshfordSources:Current estimate of Antimatter, courtesy of Elise : Stefan Ulmer made a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on energy and power consumption. The explanation goes as follows:  1.       CERN produces 3e7 antiprotons per AD cycle or about 1e15 per year2.       This is about 1e15*1.67e-27kg = 1.67 nanogram per year3.       1 gram of antiprotons has an energy (E=mc^2) of 9e13 Joule4.       The efficiency of the antiproton production process is 1e-9, so you need a billion times more energy: 9e22 Joule5.       The cost of power for CERN is 1kWh = 3.6e6 Joule = 0.1 euro6.       So that would make 0.1/3.6e6*9e22 = 2.5e15 euro7.

Was it really a meritless suit or is there more to the story?  If you’re in the market for a great suit, I can’t recommend Indochino highly enough and Legal Eagles get a discount!  https://bit.ly/2IeeB8WSummary from Vulture: Remember back in 2017 when John Oliver did a Last Week Tonight segment about coal company CEO and “geriatric Dr. Evil” Bob Murray, then — as predicted — was sued by Bob Murray the following week? Oliver couldn’t discuss the lawsuit while it was ongoing, but we did get an update when the case was dismissed in February 2018, when Oliver, referencing the original segment, told Murray to “eat shit.” What you might not know, however, is that Murray appealed the case after it was dismissed, so Oliver was yet again forced into silence until the case was recently dropped. Which brings us to last night’s Last Week Tonight, when Oliver was finally free to recap the entire saga … and, in doing so, to start a whole new saga too.(Thanks to Indochino for sponsoring this video)------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Welcome to Real Law Review by LegalEagle; a series where I try to tackle the most important legal issues of the day.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial► Edited ByBecky Johnson"

A millionaire by 26, Graham’s income fluctuates between $60,000 and $221,000 per month depending on how much he earns from real estate commissions and YouTube related-revenue. He also owns several rental properties in the Los Angeles area. Between his high income and budget-conscious nature (and 20 cent iced coffee), Graham saves nearly 99% of his income.This is the latest installment of Millennial Money, which profiles people across the U.S. and details how they earn and spend their money.Read more about Graham's budget breakdown here: https://cnb.cx/2QExENLGraham Stephan pulls up to a high-end Hollywood Hills property in his matte black Tesla Model 3. It’s a four-bed, 2,300-square-foot home listed for $2.169 million by The Oppenheim Group, where Stephan has worked as a realtor since 2015.He’s sold multiple properties like it — and every time he closes a deal, he collects a nice commission check.As of September 2019, Stephan has earned $77,152 in real estate commissions on the five properties he’s sold so far this year. But that represents just a fraction of his income. While the 29-year-old millionaire got his start in real estate, he now earns most of his money making YouTube videos.Stephan, who was born and raised in Los Angeles, never dreamed he’d make his living as a YouTuber. He was earning good money as a realtor, a career he started at 18 after he didn’t get into college. He’d watched YouTube videos for years — “it was my version of TV,” he tells CNBC Make It — but didn’t think he had the personality to be a creator himself. “It looked like such a fun thing to do and I’d always wanted to do it, but I also felt like, Who would want to watch me?”About three years ago, he decided to film and upload a video. It was an explainer on how to be a successful real estate agent that he shot “selfie-style” on his iPhone.“I remember that video getting nine or 10 views,” says Stephan, “and thinking, Oh my God, nine people somewhere have seen this video! So I started making more videos. Once I started doing about two videos a week, the growth really just exploded.”Today, Stephan has close to 1.5 million subscribers across two channels. He earns an average of $90,684 a month on the platform and will bring in well over $1 million for 2019. His videos cover a range of topics, from how to build wealth as a teen to buying a Tesla “for free.” And he regularly posts reaction videos to CNBC Make It’s Millennial Money series, offering commentary on how the subjects could improve their finances.This year will be the first time he’s earned seven figures in a calendar year, a milestone he’s been striving for since 2017. “Two years ago, I made a goal challenge video,” says Stephan. “My goal was to make $1 million in 2018.” He didn’t quite achieve it, but he surprised even himself by hitting it just a year later.» Subscribe to CNBC Make It.: http://cnb.cx/2kxl2rfAbout CNBC Make It.: CNBC Make It. is a new section of CNBC dedicated to making you smarter about managing your business, career, and money.Connect with CNBC Make It.

Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chair, said that Gordon Sondland's testimony was a seminal moment in our investigation, adding that the evidence brought forward by the U.S. ambassador to the European Union was deeply significant and troubling. Schiff spoke after the testimony from Sondland on Nov. 20, in a public hearing as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Other government officials have testified that Sondland helped push Ukraine to investigate the 2016 elections, the Ukrainian company Burisma and the Biden family. In a July 25 call that has become the focus of the impeachment inquiry, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.For more on who’s who in the Trump impeachment inquiry, read: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/whos-who-in-the-trump-impeachment-inquiryStream your PBS favorites with the PBS app: https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twGFind more from PBS NewsHour at https://www.pbs.org/newshourSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6Follow us:Facebook: http://www.pbs.org/newshourTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/newshourInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/newshourSnapchat: @pbsnewsSubscribe:PBS NewsHour podcasts: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcastsNewsletters: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe"

The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Two boasts 16 celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The Flamingo, The Leopard and The Egg.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity.

In “Frozen 2,” she must hope they are enough. From the Academy Award®-winning team—directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, producer Peter Del Vecho and songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez—and featuring the voices of Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, Jonathan Groff and Josh Gad, Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Frozen 2” opens in U.S. theaters on Nov. 22, 2019.Frozen 2 soundtrack is available now!

In responding, he admitted to feeling exactly like the rest of us do about Justice League.The DC Movie Universe has been on a roll for the last couple years or so; 2017's Wonder Woman was a critical and box office hit, and more recently, last year's Aquaman and this year's Joker have both cleared the billion dollar mark at the worldwide box office while satisfying the fandom. Prior to these successes, though, the road was quite a bit rockier — and that rocky stretch included the entirety of Cavill's tenure as Big Blue  — so far, anyway.2013's Man of Steel led off the franchise, and while it performed respectably, it divided fans — many of whom were unprepared for writer David S. Goyer and director Zak Snyder's exceedingly dark vision of the Last Son of Krypton's tale. That flick was followed by 2016's Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, a film which probably should have broken every box office record in existence due to its pairing of the two comic book icons onscreen for the first time.The flick did clear $870 million globally, but critics were generally not impressed, and it divided audiences even more sharply; industry observers noted that the failure of a movie with both Batman and Superman in its title to make over a billion dollars was troubling. 2016's Suicide Squad, which endured a mid-production course correction aimed at injecting a bit more levity, continued the trend of earning respectable box office numbers while getting mostly trashed by critics — and then came 2017's Justice League. Wooo, boy… The team-up film reunited Ben Affleck's Batman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman with Cavill's Superman, and also introduced Jason Momoa's Aquaman, Ezra Miller's the Flash, and Ray Fisher's Cyborg. Despite production troubles, it was a film that should have had DC fans over the moon with excitement. It... did not. Justice League struggled to a $677 million worldwide gross, the worst performance for a DC Movie Universe film thus far — and for the reason why, look no further than Cavill's assessment of his three outings as Supes.There's no denying that Justice League indeed didn't work, although things may have turned out differently had Snyder not handed over the reins to Joss Whedon following a family tragedy. By all accounts, the film turned in by Whedon was a very, very different one from that which would have been fielded by Snyder — so much so that in the years since Justice League's release, fans have been lobbying hard for studio Warner Bros. to release Snyder's cut of the film, which the director has said would need only a few CGI tweaks to complete. Here's hoping!The movie's failure, though, has contributed to the public perception that Cavill may indeed be done playing Superman. His Dawn of Justice co-star Affleck has hung up Batman's cape and cowl for good, making way for a different, younger iteration of the Caped Crusader to be portrayed by Robert Pattinson in writer/director Matt Reeves' forthcoming The Batman; while no comparable Superman project has yet been announced, it seems like just a matter of time before Big Blue gets the reboot treatment, as well. The perception that Cavill is through was further bolstered by his non-cameo at the end of this year's Shazam!, in which Supes showed up to have a bite of lunch with the titular hero — and was portrayed by a stand-in, shown only from the neck down. For the record, though, Cavill only failed to reprise his role because of scheduling conflicts with Mission: Impossible - Fallout — and to hear the star tell it, he may not be as done with Superman as everyone seems to think he is. The actor said:The cape is still in the closet. It's still mine. I'm not just going to sit quietly in the dark as all this stuff is going on. I've not given up the role. There's a lot I have to give for Superman yet. A lot of storytelling to do. A lot of real, true depths to the honesty of the character I want to get into. I want to reflect the comic books. That's important to me. There's a lot of justice to be done for Superman.That is far, far more than Cavill has had to say on the subject in the last couple of years. If we're being honest, we've always felt like his version of Supes got the short end of the stick, and his obvious sense of ownership over the role has us pretty much convinced that he should be given a chance to flesh out the character in a way that his previous appearances didn't quite allow for. So: does Cavill have an actual status for us on the future of his version of Superman?According to Cavill, quote, The status is: You'll see.Watch the video to see Henry Cavill admit what we suspected all along!#HenryCavill #DCEU #Superman"

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial► Edited ByBecky Johnson"

That’s because it was her first televised performance in 2 years. The last time Selena performed live at an awards show was also at the American Music Awards in 2017, when she performed her new collaboration with Marshmallow - “Wolves”.Selena has won one American Music Award, back in 2016 for “Favorite Pop/Rock female artist”. This year though, she wasn’t nominated for any - since her music came out too late to be qualified. But she was still asked to perform and open up the ceremony. And the stakes were twice as high for Selena, who performed not one but two of her brand new songs to open up the award show. And she certainly gave an emotional performance. She started off crooning to her slow-jam “Lose You To Love Me” in a long black turtleneck. Afterwards she transformed into a disco queen with a VERY quick costume change into this sequined body-suit.She followed up her first single with her brand new hit “Look at Her Now”. And her friends Halsey and Taylor were cheering her on the entire way. But people online were a little less supportive.Some people accused her of lip-syncing her second song, “Look at Her Now”, while other people actually said that she SHOULD have lip-synced both of her songs. That’s because her performance of “Look at her now” was a bit different than the recorded version that we’re used to. This past week, Selena announced her upcoming album will come out on January 10, 2020. Right now, it’s expected to be a self-titled album, or called “SG2”, but we’re supposed to get more details on that in the next few weeks. So I’m really looking forward to seeing what comes from that.But in the meantime, keep watching our American Music Awards coverage tonight, because we’ve still got a lot coming your way!

Almost like your lift pinky. While they are magical devices that can do pretty much anything, phones aren’t invincible! Do you know, for example, that your phone uses the battery to search for reception? This will seriously drain it! By the way, don't let your phone lose its battery completely before you charge it. Just wait ‘til it gets below that 30% line. If you plug in your phone every time it gets a little below 100%, eventually, it will have a hard time recharging.

Your phone might also be able to tell you when you last charged it. - If your phone is hooked up to your charger and keeps charging after it’s reached 100%, it can drain the battery.- Keep charging past that for hours while you’re in a deep slumber. In the morning you’ll find that your phone probably won’t stay at a very full battery for long!- If there are any tears in the cord you haven’t noticed, or if it doesn’t fit just right in your phone’s charging port, you might be at risk for a spark. - Don't let your phone lose its battery completely before you charge it; just wait ‘til it gets below that 30% line. - If you keep using your phone while it’s plugged in, it won’t charge as quickly, and the battery will drain faster after you unplug it. - If it’s super cold or super hot, it’s not good for your phone. Either one can hurt its internal parts!- If your screen is black, your phone doesn’t have to “work” to light up any brightly colored pixels.- Yeah, it might get a little annoying unlocking your phone more often, but setting a 15 to 30-second timeout can go a long way! - Each time you light up your screen, it uses a little bit of battery.

It doesn’t matter which diet plan you are following right now to lose weight, the key to your long term permanent success lies much deeper. Even science based diet plans that claim to prove the fastest way to lose body fat won’t stand the test of time if you are unable to do the most important thing when it comes to nutrition, and that is stay consistent with your approach.In this video, I show you the number one truth about nutrition and losing weight. Without consistency, your chance of keeping off the weight you lost is almost zero. The most important thing you can do is not turn to the latest pubmed studies to supposedly prove how you should be eating but rather determine if the way you decide to eat is going to be something you can do forever.I’m actually not one to demonize one way of eating over another. Instead, I encourage everyone to adopt the nutrition plan that is most conducive to their lifestyle and is going to be something that they can do for the foreseeable future. This often revolves around a much deeper ideology and one important unavoidable truth.And that is, getting ripped and losing fat is going to take commitment. Period. It is going to take a long term permanent commitment to either spending a bit more time than you are right now or money to get where you want to be. This can be boiled down to a simple three words and how they interplay together to formulate these requirements. These are fast, cheap and good. When it comes to nutrition and eating you can get fast, cheap and good but you can’t get all three. In fact, you can only choose two of these three options.  In only one world is it possible to get fast, cheap and good nutrition and that is if you are living at home with your parents and they are spending the time, money and effort to prepare your foods for you but even in this example, someone is still sacrificing something - it’s just not you.More realistically, you are going to have to choose from these other options. In fact, there are only two viable options to diet success since the fast and cheap option is usually one that isn’t conducive to what you’re trying to achieve with your body goals. When you go this route you are left with foods that are likely not healthy or good. This is a quick road to disaster and not one that is recommended.This leaves the other two options. If you go the fast and good route then you are likely going to have to take advantage of pre-cooked foods in your local Whole Foods or even start using a meal prep company to provide your meals for you. Both of these are going to require a financial commitment that you may or may not be able or ready to make. On the other hand, if you would prefer to save a good bit of money you can purchase these foods yourself in their raw, natural states and then cook them yourself. This of course if going to take much more time and is going to require that you are willing to make the time commitment to getting this done consistently.  Even if you do a full day meal prep or choose to prepare your meals daily.The fact is, you can’t escape nutrition commitment when you want to get your diet right and lose weight. Losing body fat is one of the hardest things you can do because it takes a 24/7 commitment that many people can’t make. Anyone can get themselves to go to the gym for an hour a few times a week but it takes a lot more effort to be conscientious of what you’re eating for the remaining 23 hours. Don’t get fooled by quick fixes. There is no such thing when it comes to getting ripped.If you’re looking for daily guidance on how to make this process much more automatic for you, then I think I can really help you out. My step by step meal plans are available in all of our programs available at the link below, depending on your exact training goals right now.

Growing up, Lizzie never realized how deeply she was affected by what she saw on the news and experienced at school. But when she took the time to look back, she started to understand that events she experienced really impacted her way of thinking and daily life, and the level of her anxiety. When Lizzie was younger, she lived at Fort Hood - the biggest U.S. military base in the country. She was there when a horrible shooting happened. The day after the horrific event, she went to school and saw armed guards surrounding the building. When she approached a guard, he assured her that he was there to protect her. But because Lizzie was so young, she didn't understand why she needed to be protected at school. At such a young age, the whole thing was really confusing. Then, when Lizzie was in middle school, another student brought a weapon to school. The student was caught before he was able to use his weapon, and the school was able to avoid a potentially dangerous situation. However, even though Lizzie was so grateful that things didn't escalate, the whole experience still really scared her. After that, Lizzie felt a similar sense of fear, confusion and sadness when she heard about the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook. She couldn't imagine how the victims must have felt, and she hugged her younger brother and told him she loved him after hearing about what happened on the news. Then, when Lizzie was a senior in high school, she found out about another tragedy at Stoneman Douglas. As much as it broke her heart to hear about yet another school shooting, Lizzie couldn't help but feel numb to the pain - and that scared her even more. After each event, Lizzie became more anxious in her daily life. When her school had an active shooter drill, she couldn't help but fear the worst, and she immediately texted her brother to make sure he was okay. Lizzie believes that, although this is hard for anyone to comprehend, it is especially difficult for kids and teenagers. She doesn't understand why her generation has to feel any sense of fear when walking into a school, going to a store or heading to a movie. She may think to herself, When did this become normal? However, Lizzie has hope for the future. She thinks that her generation will be the change that the world needs to make a difference, and she is hopeful that future generations will not have experience what Lizzie and her classmates went through.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

I started by using a brick mold made of fired clay from a previous video and made bricks from clay. The bricks were allowed to dry and were then transported to my hut using a brick carrying harness I made from cane and a piece of wood. They were dry stacked onto the wall of the hut to keep them out of the rain while waiting to be fired. I then constructed a brick kiln using mud as a mortar for adhering the bricks together. The kiln had 2 fireboxes side by side and was of the updraft kiln type. The kiln was open at the front and back so it could be stoked from these areas. This gave a more consistent firing I found then a kiln only with firebox opening at the front. I put 40 un-fired bricks into the kiln and fired them for 2 hours 30 minutes. All the bricks were fired sufficiently. I then tested an un-fired brick and a fired one by putting them in water. The un-fired brick dissolved quickly while the fired one survived completely intact. The test was a success. My only issue is the bricks are a little weak due to the clay they're made of. I'll look at refining clay or finding a better source somewhere in this area.  About Primitive Technology:Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.
